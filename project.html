    <h1>What is a British Shorthair Cat </h1>
    <a href="index.html">Back to my project</a>
  
    <h2>The animal I am choosing is British Shorthair and they come from Great Britain.
    British shorthairs are friendly relaxed pets who enjoy the company of people and napping on the couch. 
    They're large cats with exceptionally soft fur making them cozy companions for cat lovers of all ages. 
    The British shorthair personality is friendly and calm making them good family pets that adapt well to house or apartment living.
    British shorthairs are friendly, if not overly affectionate. They arenâ€™t inclined to cuddle because their thick fur makes close contact feel too warm.
    They are also fine spending time alone when the family needs to leave the house. 
    They are not energetic or athletic cats and dont require a lot of physical activity
    </h2>
  
    <h1>Habitat and Natural Environment</h1>
  
    <h2>British Shorthair cats are known for being easygoing, loyal, and affectionate, but they may have some unique behaviors but British Shorthairs enjoy playing,
    but they don't need a lot of attention. They may find someone to play with and bring them a toy or they just might play by themselves
    British Shorthair cats are adaptable and can live in many different environments but they are generally considered indoor cats because are not fast or agile enough to escape predators, 
    so they should stay indoors
    </h2>
  
    <h1>Diet and Nutrition </h1>
  
    <h2>British Shorthair will thrive on a high-protein diet but may get bored of the same old cat food quickly. 
    The diet of any cat must be appropriate for their age and life-stage British Shorthairs thrive on a healthy diet of any complete meat based cat food. 
    British Shorthairs should be rich in high-quality protein sources, such as chicken or fish, to support muscle development and maintenance.
    </h2>

    <h1>Behavior and Characteristic </h1>
  
    <h2>The female British Shorthair is a very pleasant cat to have as a companion. Its easy going and placid. 
    The British is a fiercely loyal loving cat and will attach herself to every one of her family members. 
    While the British loves to play they doesn't need hourly attention. If they in a  mood to play they will find someone and bring a toy to that person. 
    The British also plays well by themself and thus is a good companion for single people. A male British Shorthairs tend to be more sociable than females. 
    They are fantastic with kids and cat friendly dogs and typically take less time to get used to their new home and form a strong bond with the family. 
    </h2>

    <h1> Care and Maintenance </h1>

    <h2>British shorthairs don't require more maintenance than most housecats, but they do need attention to all their needs. 
    British shorthairs have thick velvety fur that is very soft to the touch. Brush your British Shorthair once or twice a week with a metal tooth comb or rubber brush to help remove loose hair.
    During shedding seasons such as the spring we recommend once a day brushing. British Shorthair cats also need daily tooth brushing to help prevent dental disease.
    </h2>

    <h1>Fun Facts</h1>
    <h2>Fun facts about them is that from 2011-2014 a British Shorthair cat held the title for the world's loudest purr.
    Some well known fictional cats have been based on British Shorthair.The most popular cats include Puss in Boots and the Cheshire Cat. 
    British Shorthairs are known as one of the oldest cat breeds in the world.
